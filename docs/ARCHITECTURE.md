## **ðŸ”§ Nevermined Integration Architecture Details**

### **Core Components (Updates & Additions)**

#### **1. Backend (Node.js/Express/Vercel Serverless)**
- **Nevermined SDK Integration**: A dedicated service/module (`NeverminedService`) to encapsulate all interactions with the Nevermined SDK. This includes:
    - Managing identities (DIDs) and wallets.
    - Interacting with Nevermined smart contracts for credit plans and agreements.
    - Publishing prompt assets and creating service execution agreements (SEAs).
    - Executing LLM tasks through credited agents on Nevermined.
- **Enhanced `CostCalculator`**:
    - Incorporates logic to calculate costs for credit-based executions.
    - Compares direct API costs vs. Nevermined credit costs.
    - Fetches credit pricing from Nevermined or configuration.
- **Enhanced `ABTestExecutor` (or similar service)**:
    - Includes `executeWithCredits` method to run tests via Nevermined agents.
    - Handles task creation and result retrieval from Nevermined.
- **New API Endpoints for Credits**:
    - `/api/credits/plans`: List available credit plans.
    - `/api/credits/purchase`: Initiate credit purchase (potentially linking to Nevermined Market or a custom UI).
    - `/api/credits/balance`: Check user's credit balance for specific plans.
    - `/api/credits/comparison`: Endpoint to provide data for comparing direct vs. credit costs for specific scenarios.

#### **2. Frontend (React/TypeScript)**
- **Credit Management UI**:
    - Display available credit plans and their pricing.
    - Interface for purchasing credits (may redirect to Nevermined Market).
    - View current credit balances.
- **Test Configuration Update**:
    - Allow users to select execution method: Direct API call vs. Nevermined Credited Agent.
    - If Nevermined, allow selection of specific credited agents/plans.
- **Enhanced `CostDashboard` & Results Display**:
    - Show side-by-side comparison of direct API costs vs. credit-based costs.
    - Visualize savings achieved using Nevermined credits.
    - Display metrics like "cost per 1k tokens via credits" vs. "direct cost per 1k tokens".

#### **3. Data Layer (Updates)**
- **Nevermined Network**: Serves as the decentralized backend for:
    - Storing credit plan details (as digital assets).
    - Managing credit token balances.
    - Registering AI agents and their service offerings.
    - Recording service execution agreements and task statuses.
- **Application Database/Cache (Optional Enhancement)**:
    - May cache credit plan details or user balances for faster UI display, synchronizing periodically with the Nevermined network.

### **Data Flow for Credit-Based Execution**

1.  **User Configuration**: User selects a prompt, input, and chooses "Execute with Nevermined Credits," selecting a specific AI agent/plan.
2.  **Backend Request**: Frontend sends the request to a new backend endpoint (e.g., `/api/test/execute-with-credits`).
3.  **Credit Check**: `NeverminedService` checks the user's credit balance for the selected plan.
4.  **Task Creation (Nevermined)**: If sufficient credits, `NeverminedService` uses the SDK to:
    *   Prepare the LLM call (interpolate prompt, define parameters).
    *   Create a task/job with the chosen Nevermined AI agent.
    *   Lock the necessary credits for the execution.
5.  **Execution via Agent**: The Nevermined AI agent performs the LLM call.
6.  **Result & Tracing**:
    *   Agent returns the result.
    *   `NeverminedService` retrieves the result.
    *   OpenTelemetry instrumentation (if the agent supports it, or via wrapper) captures trace data. Phoenix receives trace.
7.  **Cost Calculation**:
    *   `CostCalculator` uses the actual credits consumed (from Nevermined task result or estimated if pre-paid) and the credit plan's price to determine the USD cost.
    *   Compares this with the hypothetical direct API cost for the same operation.
8.  **Response to Frontend**: Backend sends the LLM response, actual credit cost, direct API cost comparison, and any trace IDs to the frontend.
9.  **UI Display**: Frontend displays the result, detailed cost breakdown (credits vs. direct), and links to Phoenix traces.

### **Monetization Flow (Selling Prompts)**

1.  **Prompt Creation**: User finalizes an optimized prompt in the GUI.
2.  **Publish to Nevermined**: User chooses to "Monetize Prompt."
    *   `NeverminedService` facilitates publishing the prompt template (and potentially its optimal execution parameters) as a digital asset on Nevermined.
    *   A service agreement is defined, specifying the price per execution (in credits or a direct payment handled by Nevermined).
3.  **Discovery & Purchase**: Other users can discover this monetized prompt in a marketplace (potentially a Nevermined marketplace or a section within the Arize GUI). They purchase access, and Nevermined handles the value exchange.
4.  **Execution by Buyer**: The buyer executes the prompt, with Nevermined managing the access rights and payment to the original prompt creator.

This integration aims to provide significant cost savings through bulk credit purchases and enables a new monetization vector for optimized prompts, all managed transparently through the Arize A/B Testing GUI.
