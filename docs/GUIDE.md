# A/B Testing GUI Implementation Guide

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Phoenix server running (local or cloud)
- OpenAI/Anthropic API keys
- Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript

## Phase 1: Phoenix Setup

### 1.1 Start Phoenix Server
```bash
# Local installation
pip install arize-phoenix
phoenix serve

# Or use Docker
docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

### 1.2 Configure Environment
```bash
# .env file
PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:6006
PHOENIX_API_KEY=your-api-key  # If using cloud
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
```

## Phase 2: Backend Setup

### 2.1 Initialize Project
```bash
mkdir ab-testing-gui && cd ab-testing-gui
npm init -y
npm install express @arizeai/phoenix-client openai @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-node @arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-openai
```

### 2.2 Create Instrumentation
Create `src/instrumentation.ts` to setup tracing with token capture.

⚠️ **Important**: For detailed step-by-step instructions on setting up instrumentation with token capture, see the [@INSTRUMENTATION.md](./INSTRUMENTATION.md) guide. This covers:
- Required dependencies installation
- Complete instrumentation code with token cost calculation
- Environment configuration
- Type declarations
- Troubleshooting common issues

### 2.3 Build API Server
Create `src/server.ts` with endpoints for:
- Prompt management (CRUD operations)
- Test execution with tracing
- Cost calculation from spans
- Session management

⚠️ **Important**: For detailed step-by-step instructions on building the complete API server, see the [@SERVER.md](./SERVER.md) guide. This covers:
- Complete server implementation with Express.js
- Service modules (PromptService, TestExecutor, CostCalculator, SessionManager)
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- File upload handling for datasets
- Authentication and rate limiting
- Error handling and testing examples

## Phase 3: Frontend Development

### 3.1 Setup React App
```bash
npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript
cd frontend
npm install @arizeai/phoenix-client axios recharts
```

### 3.2 Build UI Components
- **PromptEditor**: Monaco editor with variable highlighting
- **TestRunner**: Dataset upload and execution controls
- **TraceViewer**: Real-time span visualization
- **CostDashboard**: Token usage and cost charts

### 3.3 Implement State Management
Use React Context for:
- Active prompts
- Test results
- Trace data
- Cost metrics

## Phase 4: Integration

### 4.1 Connect Frontend to Backend
- WebSocket for real-time trace updates
- REST API for prompt operations
- Streaming for LLM responses

### 4.2 Implement Cost Tracking
- Parse token counts from span attributes
- Apply model-specific pricing
- Aggregate costs by test run
- Display cost comparison charts

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

### 5.1 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for cost calculations
- Integration tests for Phoenix API
- E2E tests for complete workflow

### 5.2 Production Deployment
- Containerize with Docker
- Deploy backend to cloud provider
- Host frontend on CDN
- Configure Phoenix cloud endpoint
