# A/B Testing GUI Implementation Guide

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Phoenix server running (local or cloud)
- OpenAI/Anthropic API keys
- Basic knowledge of React and TypeScript

## Phase 1: Phoenix Setup

### 1.1 Start Phoenix Server
```bash
# Local installation
pip install arize-phoenix
phoenix serve

# Or use Docker
docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

### 1.2 Configure Environment
```bash
# .env file
PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:6006
PHOENIX_API_KEY=your-api-key  # If using cloud
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
```

## Phase 2: Backend Setup

### 2.1 Initialize Project
```bash
mkdir ab-testing-gui && cd ab-testing-gui
npm init -y
npm install express @arizeai/phoenix-client openai @opentelemetry/api @opentelemetry/sdk-node @arizeai/openinference-instrumentation-openai
```

### 2.2 Create Instrumentation
Create `src/instrumentation.ts` to setup tracing with token capture.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: For detailed step-by-step instructions on setting up instrumentation with token capture, see the [@INSTRUMENTATION.md](./INSTRUMENTATION.md) guide. This covers:
- Required dependencies installation

- Troubleshooting common issues

### 2.3 Build API Server
Create `src/server.ts` with endpoints for:
- Prompt management (CRUD operations)
- Test execution with tracing
- Cost calculation from spans
- Session management

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: For detailed step-by-step instructions on building the complete API server, see the [@SERVER.md](./SERVER.md) guide. This covers:
- Complete server implementation with Express.js
- Service modules (PromptService, TestExecutor, CostCalculator, SessionManager)
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates

- **TestRunner**: Dataset upload and execution controls
- **TraceViewer**: Real-time span visualization
- **CostDashboard**: Token usage and cost charts

### 3.3 Implement State Management
Use React Context for:
- Active prompts
- Test results
- Trace data
- Cost metrics

## Phase 4: Integration

### 4.1 Connect Frontend to Backend
- WebSocket for real-time trace updates
- REST API for prompt operations
- Streaming for LLM responses

### 4.2 Implement Cost Tracking
- Parse token counts from span attributes
- Apply model-specific pricing
- Aggregate costs by test run
- Display cost comparison charts

## Phase 5: Testing & Deployment

### 5.1 Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for cost calculations
- Integration tests for Phoenix API
- E2E tests for complete workflow

### 5.2 Production Deployment
- Containerize with Docker
- Deploy backend to cloud provider
- Host frontend on CDN
- Configure Phoenix cloud endpoint

---

## Phase 6: Nevermined Credit System Integration

This phase integrates Nevermined to introduce a credit-based system for LLM prompt execution, enabling cost optimization through bulk credit purchases and potential monetization of prompts.

### 6.1 Prerequisites for Nevermined
- **Nevermined SDK**: Install the relevant Nevermined SDK (e.g., `payments` or a more comprehensive one if available) for your backend environment.
  ```bash
  # Example, adjust per actual Nevermined SDK
  npm install @nevermined-io/sdk --save 
  ```
- **Wallet & DID**: Set up a development wallet with a DID registered on the Nevermined test network.
- **Testnet Tokens**: Acquire testnet USDC (or the relevant currency for Nevermined) for purchasing credits and paying for services.
- **Nevermined API Key/Config**: If required for SDK interaction with Nevermined services.
- **RPC Endpoint**: Access to a relevant blockchain testnet RPC endpoint (e.g., Sepolia, Mumbai) compatible with Nevermined.

### 6.2 Backend Setup for Nevermined

#### 6.2.1 Environment Variables
Add new variables to your `.env` file:
```bash
NEVERMINED_RPC_HOST=your_rpc_endpoint_url
NEVERMINED_ARTIFACTS_PATH=./node_modules/@nevermined-io/contracts/artifacts/
NEVERMINED_MARKETPLACE_API_URI=nevermined_marketplace_url
# Add any other SDK-specific variables, e.g., contract addresses if not auto-resolved by SDK
ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=your_development_private_key # For testnet only
```

#### 6.2.2 Nevermined Service (`src/services/neverminedService.ts`)
Create a new service to encapsulate all Nevermined SDK interactions:
- Initialize Nevermined SDK with configuration.
- Functions to:
    - Create/manage credit plans (as per `NVM-INT.md`).
    - Purchase credits for a user/plan.
    - Check credit balance for a user/plan.
    - Execute tasks via credited AI agents on Nevermined (`executeWithCredits`).
    - Publish prompts as monetizable assets.
    - Query Nevermined for agent details, service offerings.

#### 6.2.3 Update `CostCalculator.ts`
- Add methods based on `NVM-INT.md` to calculate costs for credit-based executions.
  ```typescript
  // Example addition
  public calculateCreditCost(agentDID: string, creditsUsed: number): number {
    // Fetch credit pricing for agentDID from Nevermined or config
    // const pricing = this.neverminedService.getCreditPricing(agentDID);
    // return creditsUsed * pricing.costPerCredit;
    // Temporary example based on NVM-INT.md
    const creditPricing: { [key: string]: number } = {
      'agent-1-gpt4': 0.00005,    // $0.05 per 1000 credits (assuming 1 credit = 1 unit here)
      'agent-2-gpt35': 0.00003,
      'agent-3-mini': 0.00001
    };
    return creditsUsed * (creditPricing[agentDID] || 0.00005); // Default if agent not found
  }
  ```

#### 6.2.4 Update `ABTestExecutor.ts` (or similar service)
- Integrate the `executeWithCredits` method as detailed in `NVM-INT.md`.
  - This involves checking balance, creating a task on Nevermined, and processing the result.

#### 6.2.5 New API Endpoints for Credits
Implement the Vercel serverless functions for credits:
- `api/credits/plans.ts`: Fetch and list available credit plans from Nevermined or a pre-configured list.
- `api/credits/purchase.ts`: Handle requests to purchase credits (this might involve redirecting to Nevermined Market or using SDK functions).
- `api/credits/balance.ts`: Allow users to check their current credit balance for specific plans/agents.
- `api/credits/comparison.ts`: Provides data for comparing direct API call costs vs. Nevermined credit costs (as outlined in `NVM-INT.md`).
- `api/test/execute-with-credits.ts`: New endpoint to handle test executions via Nevermined.

### 6.3 Frontend Development for Nevermined

#### 6.3.1 Install SDK (if needed for frontend interactions, e.g., wallet connection)
```bash
# If direct frontend interaction with Nevermined is needed
# npm install @nevermined-io/sdk-js # or similar
```

#### 6.3.2 New UI Components
- **CreditManagementDashboard (`CreditDashboard.tsx`)**:
    - Display list of available credit plans (fetched from `/api/credits/plans`).
    - Show current credit balance (fetched from `/api/credits/balance`).
    - Interface to purchase credits (e.g., input amount, select plan, call `/api/credits/purchase`).
- **CostComparisonWidget (`CostComparisonWidget.tsx`)**:
    - As detailed in `NVM-INT.md`, to show side-by-side cost of direct API vs. credits.
    - Fetches data from `/api/credits/comparison` or calculates based on test results.

#### 6.3.3 Update Existing Components
- **Test Execution UI (e.g., `OpenAIPlayground.tsx` or `TestRunner.tsx`)**:
    - Add option to select execution method: "Direct API" or "Nevermined Credits".
    - If "Nevermined Credits" is chosen, allow selection of an AI agent/plan (fetched from backend).
    - Call the new `/api/test/execute-with-credits` endpoint.
- **`CostDashboard.tsx`**:
    - Integrate the `CostComparisonWidget` or similar display to show potential savings with credits.
    - Display data from `/api/credits/comparison` endpoint, perhaps comparing overall spending if direct vs. if credits were used.
- **Business Impact Calculator UI**:
    - Update to incorporate credit savings data from `BusinessImpactCalculator.ts` enhancements.

### 6.4 Integration & Workflow
- Connect new frontend components to the new backend API endpoints for credits.
- Ensure the test execution flow allows users to choose between direct and credit-based execution.
- Display comparative cost information clearly in the UI.
- For prompt monetization: Add UI elements to "Publish Prompt to Nevermined" and potentially a view to see published/monetized prompts.

### 6.5 Testing Nevermined Integration
- Test credit purchase flow (simulated or on testnet).
- Verify balance checking.
- Test execution of prompts via credited agents on Nevermined testnet.
- Validate cost calculations for credit-based executions against direct API calls.
- Test monetization flow: publishing a prompt and simulating a purchase/execution by another user.
